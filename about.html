						<h2>About me</h2>
						<p>I am a cyclist! Although I have been doing it for just 2 years, I identify as one. I give my all to the things that I love to do. As I have decided on a path for cycling, I have done so for computers as well.
						</p>

						<p>
						I have been working with computers since the day I could no longer play a certain video game on my parents computer. I wondered why and I found out the graphics card wasn't good enough. It was early in high school. I saved up for it and did my research. Soon I found myself fiddling with all different aspect of computing, eventually landing myself in the high school's computer program.
						</p>

						<p>
						My passion only grew from then on and after testing the water in many aspects of computing, I have decided to study for DevOps. I am currently on a track to complete System Administration and proceed to DevOps. I am enjoying my experience as a developer.
